I am a third-year Computer Science PhD student in the [EconCS](https://econcs.seas.harvard.edu) and [Theory](https://toc.seas.harvard.edu/) groups at Harvard University. I am extremely fortunate to be advised by [Ariel Procaccia](http://procaccia.info) and am supported by a NSF Graduate Research Fellowship. My research interests include online algorithms, algorithmic game theory, and computational social choice.

I completed my undergraduate degree in Computer Science at Princeton University, where I had the pleasure of working with [Matt Weinberg](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~smattw/) and [Ben Raphael](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~braphael/). After graduation, I spent a year working as a quantative research engineer at [Citadel](https://www.citadel.com/what-we-do/global-quantitative-strategies/). Before joining Harvard, I was lucky to work with [Samir Khuller](https://www.samirkhuller.com/) and [Sami Davies](http://samidavies.com/) as a visiting student at Northwestern University.
